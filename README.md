### About Mastodon API query URL

First, you need to get your account ID, according to [Lookup account ID from Webfinger address - Mastodon documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/accounts/#lookup), you can make a request to your instance:

```sh
> curl 'https://<your-instance>/api/v1/accounts/lookup?acct=<your-username>'
{"id":"72358"...}%
       ^^^^^
       account ID
```

Then, you can refer to [Get accountâ€™s statuses - Mastodon documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/accounts/#statuses), here is an example:

```sh
> # get all statuses tagged with `#photography`, excepted the ones without media attachments.
> curl 'http://<your-instance>/api/v1/accounts/<your-account-id>/statuses?only_media=true&tagged=photography'
```

Once you get a satisfied URL, put it into `query` in `config.tsx`.
